### The Dog and the Hare

A Hound,  
having started a Hare on the hill-side,  
pursued her for some distance,   
at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life,  
and at another time fawning upon her,   
as if in play with another dog.   
The Hare said to him,
"I wish you would act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors. if you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? if an enemy, why do you fawn on me?"

### The Fox and the Mask

A fox entered the house of an actor,  
and,  
rummaging through all his properties,  
came upon a Mask,   
an admirable imitation of a human head.   
He placed his paws on it,  
and said,  
"What a beautiful head! Yet it is of no value, as it entirely wants brains."
